class Solution:
    def surfaceArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the total surface area of 3D shapes formed by stacking 1 x 1 x 1 cubes on an n x n grid.

        Each cell grid[i][j] represents a tower of grid[i][j] stacked cubes.
        After stacking, any cubes that are directly adjacent are glued together,
        forming irregular 3D shapes. The surface area includes the bottom face of each cube.

        Args:
            grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list where each entry represents the height of stacked cubes at that cell.

        Returns:
            int: The total surface area of all the resulting shapes.

        Example:
            >>> surfaceArea([[1,2],[3,4]])
            34

        Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the dimension of the grid.
        Space Complexity: O(1), uses constant extra space.
