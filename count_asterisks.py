class Solution:
    def countAsterisks(self, s: str) -> int:
        """Counts asterisks in a string, excluding those between pairs of vertical bars.

        The string is processed by grouping consecutive vertical bars '|' into pairs.
        Asterisks that appear between any pair of '|' are excluded from the count.

        Args:
            s (str): Input string containing asterisks and vertical bars

        Returns:
            int: Number of asterisks not enclosed between pairs of vertical bars

        Examples:
            >>> countAsterisks("l|*e*et|c**o|*de|")
            2  # Only counts asterisks outside pairs of '|'
            >>> countAsterisks("yo|uar|e**|b|e***au|tifu|l")
            5  # Counts asterisks in "yo", "e**", "e***au", and "l"
