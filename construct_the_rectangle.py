        Given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, return rectangular,
        whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
        
            The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
            The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
            The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

        Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and
        width of the web page you designed in sequence.
