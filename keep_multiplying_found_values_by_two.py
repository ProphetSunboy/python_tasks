        """Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `original`, repeatedly double `original` as long as it is found in `nums`.
        Return the final value of `original` after this process.

        Args:
            nums (list[int]): The list of integers to search within.
            original (int): The starting integer to search for and double.

        Returns:
            int: The resulting value of `original` after all possible doublings.

        Example:
            >>> findFinalValue([5,3,6,1,12], 3)
            24

        Time complexity: O(n + k), where n is the length of nums and k is the number of doublings.
        Space complexity: O(n)
