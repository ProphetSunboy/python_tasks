        """Calculate final prices with special discounts for items in a shop.

        For each item, apply a discount equal to the price of the first subsequent item
        that has a price less than or equal to the current item's price. If no such item
        exists, no discount is applied.

        Args:
            prices (list[int]): List of item prices in the shop

        Returns:
            list[int]: List of final prices after applying discounts

        Example:
            >>> finalPrices([8,4,6,2,3])
            [4,2,4,2,3]  # 8-4=4, 4-2=2, 6-2=4, 2-0=2, 3-0=3

        Time complexity: O(nÂ²) - nested loops comparing each price with subsequent prices
        Space complexity: O(n) - stores result list of same length as input
